## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn dev** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to test, please run **yarn dev** to start the local server, **yarn knex migrate:latest --env development** to get a development database loaded up on your local machine, and **yarn knex seed:run --env development**, to seed that database with therequired files. You will need to reseed the database every time you run the tests!

### Backend framework goes here

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and GraphQL. Node.js and Express and used to serve the route needed to host the GraphQL endpoint.
The database is Postgres for production and staging with SQLite3 usedfor local development. Knex is used to manage the database implementation in all environments.

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

PORT = Whatever free port you have open will work fine, if 4000 is not available.

DATABASE_URL = This environment variable does not need to be set up locally, but is set by Heroku when enabling the postgres addon.

DB_ENV = This will default to 'development'. If you wish to use testing, please run the script `yarn test` to run the app in the testing environment. This needs to be configured on Heroku to be set to 'production' (no quotes needed when setting the variable).

SGUS = The username for SendGrid, you will need access to student-artco's SendGrid account or have one of your own.

SGPW = The password for SendGrid, you will need access to student-artco's SendGrid account or have one of your own.
